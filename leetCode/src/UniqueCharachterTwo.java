     * Problem: Consider a string that can contain only characters from a-z.
     * Write a snippet of code that returns true if this string contains unique characters.
     * The whitespaces can be ignored.
     *
     * Solution: The solution presented in the preceding coding challenge covers this case as well.
     * However, let's try to come up with a solution specific to this case.
     * The given string can contain only characters from a-z, so it can only contain ASCII codes from 97(a) to 122(z).
     * Let's consider that the given string is afghnqrsuz.
